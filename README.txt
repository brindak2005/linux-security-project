Project 1: Linux Security Basics

Goal: Learn basic linux navigation and prepare the system for security-related tasks.

What i did today:
-Logged into Ubuntu
-Used terminal commands (pwd, ls, mkdir, cd)
-Created a project folder

Linux Security Project - File Permissions
Objective:
Practice Linux file permission hardening using chmod and ls

Steps Completed:
-Created project directory
-Created README file
-Audited file permissions using ls -l
-Applied least-privilege permissions using chmod 600

Result:
File permissions restricted to owner-only access (rw-------), preventing unauthorized access by group or other users.

Skills Demonstrated:
-Linux CLI
-File permission auditing
-Chmod
-Security hardening fundamentals

Why this matters:
Restricting file permissions reduces the attack surface by preventing unauthorized users from reading or modifying sensitive files.

Next Steps:
-Practice user and group management
-Explore sudo permissions
-Analyze system logs for security events
